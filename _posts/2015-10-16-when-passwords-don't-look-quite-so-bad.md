We laugh, but beneath the humour here there's a very serious point.

If someone has the your fingerprint data, then to all intents and purposes they have your fingerprint. That's not such a problem at the moment since fingerprints tend to be part of a 2 or 3 factor combination, but unlike a password (which has a limited shelf life) your fingerprint is fixed for life.

I'm no fan of passwords, as Winston Churchill once said of democracy "they are the worst form of authentication except for all those others that have been tried from time to time", but at the moment a good password manager still looks like the best way to keep your personal information safe online.
