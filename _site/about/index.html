    <p><strong>I like joining up people and systems, and believe technology has a huge role to play in getting people sharing and collaborating.</strong></p>
<p>I think open source, open data and open standards have enormous potential to transform public services, and am a big fan of the platform work being done in GDS. I'd like to see much more of local government organisations working together to solve our common problems.</p>
<p>Much of my current work focuses on Multi-Agency working and systems integration, but I have experience across lots of areas and I'll turn my hand to anything. I also have a particular fondness for replacing people's fax machines and Access databases.</p>
<p>Outside of work I dabble in Ruby, web design and photography. I am still trying to work out how you relax when computers are your hobby as well as your job.</p>
