<h3>I like joining up people and systems, and think technology has a huge role to play in getting people sharing and collaborating.</h3>
<p>I'm also interested in the potential of open source, open data and open standards to transform public services. I have a particular fondness for replacing people's fax machines and Access databases.</p>
<p>Outside of work I dabble in Ruby, web design and photography. I am still trying to work out how you relax when computers are your hobby as well as your job.</p>
