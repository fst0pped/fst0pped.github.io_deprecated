    <li><h4><a href="https://github.com/fst0pped/RCTrandomiser">The Random Coffee Trials Randomiser</a></h5>
      <p>Very basic web app that will accept a list of group members and randomise them into pairs. Will also allow the user to download lists of members/pairs as CSV files so they can be reused and uploaded for future sessions. The code for this is open source (GPL license) <a href="https://github.com/fst0pped/RCTrandomiser">and is available on github.</a></p>
