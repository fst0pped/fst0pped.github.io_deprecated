<ul class="code_list">
  <li><p><a href="https://github.com/fst0pped/RCTrandomiser">The Random Coffee Trials Randomiser</a></p>
    <p class="desc">Very basic web app that will accept a list of group members and randomise them into pairs. Will also allow the user to download lists of members/pairs as CSV files so they can be reused and uploaded for future sessions. The code for this is open source (GPL license) <a href="https://github.com/fst0pped/RCTrandomiser">and is available on github.</a></p>
